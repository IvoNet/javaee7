# Basic Authentication

A Glassfish version of the basic authentication example from
“RESTful Java Web Services Security.”

    The main problem with this security implementation is that credentials are propagated
    in a plain way from the client to the server.
    This way, any sniffer could read the sent packages over the network.
    Excerpt From: Rene Enríquez. “RESTful Java Web Services Security.”
